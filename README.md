# Device-Agnostic Design Course Project I - c66d6a3b-4396-4c76-825b-befbd11d93ba

**NAME:** Course Project 1

**DESCRIPTION:** 
The application consists of a quiz format game where the user selects the topic he wants to answer questions about on the initial screen. The user can also view statistics on the number of questions he has correctly answered.

**KEY CHALLENGES:** 
Writing tests was the main challenge I faced, as I didn't know how to mock in Dart. Initially, changing the code to incorporate images was a bit difficult, but I was able to resolve all the issues easily.

**KEY LEARNING MOMENTS:** 
Starting with testing, I encountered two key learning moments. Firstly, when I began mocking, as I had no prior knowledge of those libraries. Then, I had to learn how to test StatefulWidgets, but once I did, I was able to handle everything. Finally, incorporating images into the app was also a significant learning experience for me, and I had to search online to understand how to implement it.
